## MSBridge v7.8 — Faster, safer, smoother

We’ve focused this release on reliability, security, and a cleaner experience across chat, settings, and streaks. Here’s what’s new.

### Highlights
- Solid app lock at cold start (PIN)
- Bottom sheets now auto-dismiss after actions
- Settings search rebuilt as a bottom sheet (fast, no flicker)
- Chat UI upgrades: image previews, stable keyboard behavior
- Streak notifications fixed (with permission prompts and test button)
- Smoother PIN screen animations and transitions

### Security & Privacy
- Fixed PIN lock persistence on cold start; the lock now shows reliably after relaunch.
- PIN lock state refreshes before first-frame decisions and the wrapper always participates.
- Security bottom sheet actions (enable/disable/change/reset PIN) now dismiss the sheet after success and won’t throw on missing routes.
- Subtle animation/perf pass on the startup PIN screen to remove jank.

### Chat AI
- Added image preview chips above the composer (with quick remove).
- Composer animates with the keyboard; global bottom navigation no longer moves.
- Kept the send button and input states snappy during uploads and sends.

### Settings UX
- Rebuilt Settings Search as a dedicated bottom sheet (like Note search):
  - Debounced, fast results, clean theme match.
  - No app bar flicker; stable focus.
- Fixed all bottom sheets in Settings to close after success or navigate-first-then-dismiss.
- Optimized app bar component and removed risky animation paths that caused “open then disappear”.

### Streaks & Notifications
- Notifications now request permission after login (Android), and we gate scheduling on permission.
- Streak “about to end” alerts:
  - Schedules for 8 PM if possible; if already past 8 PM, sends a near‑term reminder so you don’t miss it.
  - Uses the app icon in the notification (status and expanded).
- New “Send Test Urgent Reminder” button in Streak Settings to verify delivery instantly.
- Daily reminders respect the selected time and your sound/vibration preferences.
- Milestone notifications (7/30/100) are shown when enabled.

### Performance & Stability
- Reduced animation cost on PIN lock screen; added repaint boundaries and lighter shadows.
- Chat and settings interactions use safer navigation/dismiss semantics to avoid exceptions.
- Background worker re-schedules streak notifications after sync using your current settings and streak state.

### How to try it
- PIN: Enable PIN → kill app → relaunch. Lock should appear before content.
- Chat: Attach an image → preview appears above input; remove via X; keyboard no longer moves bottom nav.
- Settings search: Tap the search icon → bottom sheet opens; type to filter; tap to navigate.
- Streaks: Turn on notifications + urgent alerts → use the “Send Test Urgent Reminder” button. You should receive a notification immediately.
