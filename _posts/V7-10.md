# Introducing MSBridge 7.10.0: A Smarter Way to Manage App Updates

We’re thrilled to announce the release of MSBridge 7.10.0! This is a focused update that completely reimagines one of the most critical parts of the application lifecycle: the update process. We've rebuilt our update management system from the ground up to give you more power, flexibility, and control.

## Why this update?

Our previous update system was functional, but we knew it could be better. As applications grow in complexity, developers need more granular control over how and when users are prompted to update. A one-size-fits-all dialog isn't always the best user experience.

This update was driven by the need for a more robust and configurable solution. We wanted to empower you to tailor the update flow to your specific needs—whether that’s a critical security patch that requires an immediate, un-skippable update, or a minor feature release that users can choose to install at their convenience.

## What's New

This release centers on one major enhancement: a complete overhaul of our in-app update management.

*   **Advanced App Update Management:** We've replaced the old system with a powerful new engine for checking, fetching, and prompting for application updates. This new architecture is more reliable and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

*   **Customizable Update Dialogs:** You now have full control over the update prompts shown to users. Configure custom titles, messages, and button text to match your app’s tone and provide clear, helpful information about the new version.

*   **Flexible Configuration:** A new configuration layer has been added, allowing you to easily define update rules. You can now differentiate between mandatory (forced) updates and optional ones, ensuring users get critical patches while having a choice for minor releases.

## Fixes & Improvements

As part of this overhaul, we have removed the previous, more rigid update testing and dialog features. The new system replaces this functionality entirely, providing a more streamlined and powerful workflow for managing the end-to-end update experience.

## Upgrade Today!

With MSBridge 7.10.0, managing your application's update cycle has never been easier or more effective. Give your users a seamless and informative update experience by upgrading to the latest version today.
