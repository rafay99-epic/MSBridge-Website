Context switching kills momentum. Here are ten habits that help:

1. Batch shallow work into two time blocks per day.
2. Keep a short "parking lot" note for ideas to revisit after focus time.
3. Start the day by unblocking your team, then guard deep work.
4. Use templates for PRs, issues, and release notes.
5. Turn recurring checks into scripts.
6. Prefer pull-based notifications over push.
7. Write design docs before complex tasks.
8. Track decisions in-line near the code they affect.
9. Default to small PRs.
10. Leave a breadcrumb TODO at the end of each session so future-you knows where to start.

Which one will you try this week?
