## Discriminated Unions Over Booleans

Prefer a tagged union to multiple booleansâ€”your exhaustiveness checks become free tests.

## Narrowing Helpers

Encapsulate `in` checks inside type guards to centralize complexity.

## API Shapes With `zod` or `valibot`

Runtime validation prevents "unknown" from leaking.

## Public Types, Private Implementations

Export stable interfaces; hide concrete types and helpers.

Small choices compound in big codebases.
