The **V3 release** of our application focuses on **smarter note management, improved reliability, and a more refined user experience**.

  The app now intelligently manages internet status and fetches notes based on connectivity changes, ensuring a smoother online/offline experience.  

- **Refresh Mechanism for Notes**  
  Users can now refresh their notes display, making it easier to keep content up to date.  

- **Enhanced Empty Notes Message**  
  When no notes are available, the app now displays customizable prompts to guide users more effectively.  

- **Improved Quill Editor Integration**  
  A new method for loading note content into the Quill editor has been introduced, improving the editing experience and reliability.  

- **Notes Settings Integration**  
  Notes management is now fully integrated into the settings interface, giving users a centralized place to configure note-related preferences.  



## Improvements  

- **Enhanced Note Display**  
  Notes are now displayed with improved formatting, making them easier to read and navigate.

  Users receive clearer feedback when refreshing notes or when connectivity changes, improving responsiveness.  

- **Optimized Screen State Retention**  
  Navigation between note-taking, search, and settings is now smoother, with better state management across screens.  

- **Improved Error Handling**  
  Note operations now provide clearer and more actionable feedback when errors occur.  

- **Simplified Settings Layout**  
  The settings interface has been reorganized for better clarity and usability.  

- **Updated App Description**  
  The `pubspec.yaml` description has been updated to better reflect the appâ€™s purpose and features.  



## Why V3 Matters  

This release is a significant step forward in making the app more **resilient, user-friendly, and reliable**. With features like the recycle bin, improved syncing, and better error handling, users now have more control and confidence in managing their notes.  


## Looking Ahead  

As we move beyond V3, our focus will shift toward **collaboration features, performance optimization, and deeper integrations**. The goal is to make the app not only a personal note-taking tool but also a platform for productivity and teamwork.
