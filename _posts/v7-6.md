## Level Up Your Productivity: `v7.6` Just Dropped!

Hey there, fellow note-takers and AI conversationalists!

Get ready to experience your favorite app like never before, because `v7.6` just landed, packed with blazing-fast optimizations and some seriously cool new features. We’ve been burning the midnight oil (and maybe a few lines of code) to make your day-to-day smoother, smarter, and more secure.

Let's dive into what's new!

### Turbo-Charged Performance You'll Feel!

First up, let's talk speed. Because who has time for slow apps, right? We've rolled out some significant performance boosts that will make a real difference:

*   **Folder & Note-Taking Performance**: Navigating your folders and jotting down thoughts is now snappier than ever. Say goodbye to lag and hello to a fluid, uninterrupted workflow!
*   **MS Notes Search**: Searching through your extensive note collection? We've fine-tuned the engine, so you'll find what you're looking for in a flash. Your mental notes might take longer to retrieve than our search!

### Your AI Chat Just Got Smarter (and Prettier!)

Our AI Chat feature got a major glow-up and some incredible new capabilities:

*   **Image Upload Support**: That's right! You can now upload images to your AI model. Imagine the possibilities – describing a picture, getting ideas, or just having a more visual conversation. This is a game-changer!
*   **Chat History is Here**: Ever wished you could revisit a brilliant conversation with your AI? Now you can! The `load chat feature` is fully working, and we've refined the `chat history` experience, making it super easy to pick up where you left off.
*   **UI & Logic Overhaul**: We’ve given the chat page a complete refresh, improving both its look and the underlying logic for a more seamless and intuitive interaction.

### Enhancements That Make Life Easier

We've sprinkled improvements across the board to enhance your overall experience:

*   **Streak Notifications**: Keep that productivity streak going! We've added streak notifications to celebrate your consistency and encourage you to keep learning and creating.
*   **Enhanced Security & Sync**: We’ve beefed up `email verification`, brought `PIN lock sync` into the fold, and refined `background sync` for a more secure and consistent experience across all your devices. Your data is safer and more in sync!
*   **Smarter Notes Sharing & Error Handling**: Sharing your brilliant insights is now smoother than ever, and we've improved error handling to keep those unexpected hiccups at bay.
*   **Refined Settings & Quick Actions**: We've tidied up the settings, making it easier to customize your experience, and refactored quick actions for better accessibility and flow.
*   **Robust Search Tools**: Beyond the performance boosts, we've introduced powerful new `date range` and `tag selector` features in your notes search, giving you granular control over finding exactly what you need.

### Under the Hood Goodness

And of course, we've been busy behind the scenes! From `CI for signed APKs` ensuring smoother updates, to general `code cleanups` and `workflow improvements` (shoutout to all those `github action` commits!), we're constantly refining the foundation to deliver a stable and top-notch application.

**Ready to Experience `v7.6`?**

Update your app today and dive into a world of faster performance, smarter AI interactions, and a smoother, more secure experience. We're pretty excited about this one, and we think you will be too!

Happy note-taking and chatting!
